# Tic-tac-toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game where two players take turns playing on a 3x3 board. However, in this version, there’s a twist: instead of two human players, you will face off against a robot that automatically plays after you make your move.

To start the game, first log in through the main menu located at the top of the window. Under the "Account" section, select "Register" if you're a new user, or "Login" if you’ve registered previously and your account has been saved.

After logging in or registering, you'll be taken to the app's main page, labeled "Home." From here, you can navigate the entire application using the main menu at the top of the screen. On the "Home" tab, you can also view the statistics of your previous games.

To begin a new game, select "New Game" from the main menu. A blank 3x3 grid will appear, allowing you, the human player, to make the first move. The game will then proceed based on the moves made by you and the robot. Once the game concludes, there are three possible outcomes:

- if you win, you earn 25 points;
- if the robot wins, you earn no points;
- and if the game ends in a tie, you receive 10 points.
  After the game ends, you can choose to start a new game or return to the main statistics page.

An interesting feature of this game is the ability to use "bombs" against your opponent. Bombs allow you to remove one of the robot's moves by placing them on its filled square. You can earn bombs after every four wins or purchase them in the "Shop" tab for 100 points each. The game is set to an easy difficulty level, making it relatively simple to win.

Once you're satisfied with your progress, you can log out of your account by selecting "Log out" under the "Account" menu. After logging out, you can close the app and return to it whenever you're ready to play again.
